# stretching-timer
A simple timer for stretching

**Introduction**

This is an iOS app, supporting 11.0 or newer, showing the current time and two additional info.
1. seconds elapsed from 0 to 30 - then repeat again and again.
2. count of periods of 30 seconds - but every even periods are ignored (for rest)
3. there is a beep for every 30 seconds. (This is key: this is why I made it.)

**Usage**

1. Start the app, it will give 5 (or 4) seconds of preparation time.
2. for 30 seconds, stretch.
3. for the next 30 seconds, take rest.
4. repeat 2 & 3.
