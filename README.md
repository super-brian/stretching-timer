# stretching-timer
This repository now has one branch: the app includes a switch to toggle stretching mode and standing mode.

**Introduction**
This app helps you to stretch 30 seconds and have rest for 30 seconds (Or stand up for 30 minutes then sit down for 30 minutes) by sounding beep and vibration of the device.

This app...
1. is an iOS app, supporting 11.0 or newer.
2. shows the current time
1. also shows seconds elapsed and the number of times completed.
2. 'working' time and 'resting' time has the same amount, 30 seconds (Stretching mode) or 30 minutes (Standing mode)
3. beeps and vibrates every interval of 'working' time completes.

**Usage**

Just try it. Too easy to use.
